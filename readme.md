## Game Description


This game was created for the first Coding Blocks Game Jam #cbjam. The theme was "Everything is Broken". The idea was to create a game focused around a broken down ship, where you had to slowly "wake" personnel and bring systems online in order to fix up the ship before you were overtaken by Space Pirates. There isn't much inside the game to tell you this, because I ran short on time, but I hope you get the gist!
You are the captain of a broken down spaceship. Your goal is to fix the ship to get out of dangerous space while fending waves of space pirates. 

## Mechanics
This is a deck/engine-building game, where you accumulate cards in order increase your increase your fuel enough to "get outta here". Fuel slowly decreases over time, but there are cards you can play to increase your "energy" in order to ultimately buy more fuel. Be careful though, if you don't build a balanced deck it can be real hard to "get outta here" before the pirates arrive!
